# SPIFFS-testing WITH ERROR. "file2.read" fails !!
This project will do some initial basic reading and writing of a SPIFFS flash system.

The code will first try to locate the file "test.txt" in SPIFFS - and if not found then in the data directory.
Write the test-file onto the SPIFFS flash. Then try to read the file line by line.

PS: I am not experienced!! Be kind..
Solution will be posted here if/when found
